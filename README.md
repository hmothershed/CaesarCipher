# Caesar Cipher Cyptology - Encryption and Decryption
This is a simple project that implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in Python.
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## How it works
The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, if the shift is 3, the letter A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The encryption and decryption algorithms are based on this principle.
