# Caesar Cipher Cyptology - Encryption and Decryption
This is a simple project that implements the Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in Python.
The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.

## How it works
The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter of the plaintext by a fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, if the shift is 3, the letter A would be replaced by D, B would become E, and so on. The encryption and decryption algorithms are based on this principle.

## How to use
1. Clone the repository or download the ZIP file and extract it.
2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the repository is located
3. Run the program with the following command: python caesar_cipher.py
4. Follow the instructions to either encrypt or decrypt your message.

*Note: This is my first Python program so there are some errors that will need to be corrected. The program should only support uppercase letters, lowercase letters, and spaces. Unfortunately, for my code that is not the case and will be fixed soon.*
